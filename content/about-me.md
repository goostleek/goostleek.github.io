Hi, Iâ€™m Marcin, an [experienced software engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcinklopotek/) who believes in the quiet power of diligence and the thrill of solving problems. My skills have been honed over 15 years of real-world challenges, but I know I'm not done yet and am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.

As a passionate software engineer, I hold a deep appreciation for the craft and an ever-burning curiosity to explore new solutions. I tackle problems with the patience and precision they deserve, always with a mindset geared towards efficient and sustainable outcomes.

As an open-source contributor, I find joy in giving back to the community that has shaped me. I believe in the collective power of innovation and the sharing of knowledge that open-source embodies.

So join me at `CoreDumps`, where each [post](/posts) is a step on our shared path of technological exploration and growth. Together, weâ€™ll sift through the bytes and bits of the software world :rocket:
